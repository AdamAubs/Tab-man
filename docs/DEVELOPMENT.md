# Development Log - Tab Man

## 🎯 Project Goal

Build a collaborative expense tracking app called "Tab Man" where users can create shared tabs, invite others, and track expenses together in real-time.

## ✅ Completed Milestones

### Phase 1: Foundation & Authentication (Completed)

- ✅ **SvelteKit Setup**: Project initialized with TypeScript, Vite, and modern tooling
- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Complete authentication setup with session management
- ✅ **Database Schema**: Designed and implemented full PostgreSQL schema
  - Users, profiles, tabs, tab_members, tab_invitations, places tables
  - Row Level Security (RLS) policies for secure multi-tenant access
  - Database triggers for automatic profile creation
- ✅ **Global Types**: TypeScript definitions for database and session types
- ✅ **Server Hooks**: Session injection and authentication flow

### Phase 2: UI & Navigation (Completed)

- ✅ **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive layout optimized for mobile devices
- ✅ **Dashboard Interface**: Clean tab overview with sidebar navigation
- ✅ **Component Library**: Reusable Sidebar and TabCard components
- ✅ **Modern Styling**: CSS variables, hover effects, and smooth transitions
- ✅ **Icon Integration**: Lucide icons for consistent UI

### Phase 3: Tab Management (Completed)

- ✅ **Tab Creation Flow**: Complete form-based tab creation
  - SvelteKit server actions with validation
  - Secure data insertion with RLS compliance
  - Automatic owner assignment
- ✅ **Tab Display**: Individual tab pages with member lists
- ✅ **Security Implementation**: Fixed RLS policies for proper access control
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error states

## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Database & Security

- **Row Level Security**: Implemented and debugged complex RLS policies
- **Multi-table Operations**: Coordinated inserts across tabs and tab_members
- **Policy Optimization**: Resolved recursive policy issues and infinite loops
- **Type Safety**: Full end-to-end TypeScript coverage

### SvelteKit Mastery

- **Server Actions**: Implemented secure form handling with proper validation
- **Session Management**: Server-side session handling with Supabase
- **Error Handling**: Proper fail() responses and redirect management
- **Form Enhancement**: Manual formData handling for complex form states

### UI/UX Excellence

- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first with progressive desktop enhancement
- **Loading States**: Proper feedback during async operations
- **Error States**: User-friendly error messages and validation
- **Modern Interactions**: Hover effects, transitions, and micro-interactions

## 🐛 Challenges Solved

### 1. SvelteKit Form Submission Issues

**Problem**: Form data not being sent to server action
**Solution**: Used `bind:value` with manual formData setting in `use:enhance`

### 2. Supabase RLS Recursion

**Problem**: Infinite recursion in RLS policies causing policy_lookup errors
**Solution**: Simplified policies and restructured table access patterns

### 3. Redirect Error Messages

**Problem**: "Unexpected error: Redirect" messages in development
**Solution**: Clarified that this is normal SvelteKit behavior for successful redirects

### 4. Database Policy Conflicts

**Problem**: Conflicting RLS policies preventing tab creation
**Solution**: Systematic policy cleanup and rebuilding with proper INSERT permissions

## 📊 Current State

### What Works

- ✅ User registration and authentication
- ✅ Automatic profile creation
- ✅ Tab creation with proper ownership
- ✅ Secure data access via RLS
- ✅ Mobile-responsive interface
- ✅ Server-side session management

### Database Schema Status

```sql
-- Core tables implemented and working
profiles ✅
tabs ✅
tab_members ✅
tab_invitations ✅ (structure ready)
places ✅ (structure ready, not used yet)
```

### RLS Policies Status

- ✅ `profiles`: Users can read/update own profile
- ✅ `tabs`: Users can read tabs they're members of, insert own tabs
- ✅ `tab_members`: Users can read memberships, insert for owned tabs

## 🚀 Next Phase: Content & Collaboration

### Immediate Priorities

1. **Add Expenses to Tabs**: Implement the core expense tracking functionality
2. **Real-time Updates**: Live collaboration when users add items
3. **Invite System**: Allow users to invite others via email or links

### Feature Roadmap

- [ ] Add/edit/delete expenses within tabs
- [ ] Real-time collaboration with Supabase subscriptions
- [ ] Member invitation system
- [ ] Expense splitting calculations
- [ ] Member management (roles, permissions)
- [ ] Tab archiving and history
- [ ] Offline support and optimistic updates
- [ ] Toast notifications and improved UX
- [ ] Export functionality (PDF, CSV)

## 🛠️ Development Environment

### Tools & Technologies

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit 2.0, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Real-time)
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern features
- **Testing**: Vitest, Testing Library
- **Dev Tools**: ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript strict mode

### Development Workflow

1. Feature planning and database schema updates
2. Server action implementation with validation
3. UI component development with mobile-first approach
4. Testing and debugging with RLS policy verification
5. Integration testing and user flow validation
